Employee mentoring and continuous learning are an essential component of an effective engagement and retention strategy. Every leader of people understands that appreciating employees is motivating to any member of the team.  And while they have a fantastic effect on morale, we sometimes overlook the forgotten few – our support team.

Our research and observation in working with many organizations was that most company initiatives, training and incentives were not adequately focused enough on support staff, the people that sometimes go unnoticed.   Support staff are the clockmakers of the company, constantly keeping procedures and processes ticking over, never stopping. They work tirelessly to strive for company excellence but not always seen as a front line employee. They are the hidden heroes behind an organization’s ongoing success.

What people are longing for more and more is a sense of ownership and belonging in their workplace, the need for more feedback and growth on their personal development.

So we wanted to create something new to the market, an incentive for support; that had teeth in it, something that would continually impel progress from within.  The GLLS Competency Framework – the only framework of this kind, is designed to promote and champion the highest standards of professional competence on the part of top employees, and aspiring leaders of companies and other organisations.  Our customised and powerful program is built like a jigsaw, each piece designed to connect each distinct skillset at a time, assisting employee growth and development 365 days a year

TiQ was built from the heart, with a passion for future learning and personal growth.  We don’t just envision progress and excellence. We commit to it.

- Online and Offline Service Integration.

With the features within, people with unproductive assets can offer their goods securely to the people who need them. We also provide the offline outlet to help people easily access the service in public area, even when their cellphone is inactive.

Compared with similar initiatives, we put our focus more in improvement in transaction process than networks growth, since that is the main problem for rental business digital migration. That's why the first feature that we will introduce to the market is our redeveloped 'warnet-like' mobile billing system. We believe this will solve the main problem of the industry, in how to track usage duration and the cost resulted from It.

We want to help people, especially in developing country to earn more for their living, simply with everything they have with sharing economy principles. In the other hands, we also give an alternative for anyone who need certain goods for limited period of time to fulfill their needs with cheaper cost. We hope this system will be multiplicable internationally, so the people worldwide can feel the benefit of our platform.

Furthermore by enabling it to interwork with POS (Point Of Sale) system through Screen OCR engine that controls POS SW with 100% recognition rate, no additional training or cost would be required for employees at restaurants in implementing this new payment system. 
The most relevant market that our business could engage in could be all the franchise restaurant where self-order is mandatory, because huge amount of waiting time in franchise restaurant becomes big issue to solve in Korean society. At this point, customers’ necessity for non-face to face order and payment system is increasing. 
Since the development of  GT Pay has been already completed, we have recently gained great attention from many Van service companies in Korea, because our product, GT Pay is the first mobile based order and payment solution that enables interworking with POS (Point Of Sale) system by controlling software. And this has given us a chance to sign a contract with one of the major Van service company in Korea that has provided Van service for almost 60% of all the restaurants in Korea. 
Under the contract, our product would be allowed to be installed and implemented in 1,000 restaurants in Korea as a pilot project. 
Our profit would be made from 0.2% commission of all the payment done by GT pay. As the average annual revenue of each franchise restaurant is 24,000 USD, it would be great chance for us, if our service can be expanded to more than 10,000 restaurants.
Our goal is to increase the number of restaurant as 10,000 restaurants of those where the Van service company has provided their service within a year and next five years, GT Pay will be implemented in all the restaurants working with the van company by maintaining customer satisfaction."

The rapid development of technology, indirectly, has affected every single aspect of life of people around the world, including business. The concept of shopping from home at online store has now been chosen by many people. To be late in adopting technology means to be marginalized, losing customers, or even to be kicked out from the industry. On the other hand, the emergence of the free trade policies makes the competition harsher.

In any given situation, every company needs to communicate their business to their target market to achieve the sales target they have set. Unfortunately, many companies fail to communicate their business, even though the concept they bore was brilliant. At the same time, the development of technology makes the competition in every industry gets harder. This condition tempts many companies to use dirty tricks to win the competition even though they do not only violate the law, but also contrary to the ethical norms and injure another company.

PrasaStudio comes to provide solutions for companies in communicating their business so that they will able to keep survive in the middle of this harsh competition.
